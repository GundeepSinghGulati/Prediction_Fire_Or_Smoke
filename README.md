# Prediction_Fire_Or_Smoke
In this project, I use the Kaggle forest fire dataset which contains the images of fire and smoke with the help of this dataset I make a model which classifies whether the image contains fire or smoke. In this, I use the CNN model for classification and it gives me good accuracy and better results.
